# Project 3 - Sentiment Analysis of Fan and Stakeholder Perception on VAR Decisions Across Different Football Leagues  

## Overview  
This project explores how football fans and stakeholders perceive Video Assistant Referee (VAR) decisions across different leagues using sentiment analysis on public data available online. By analyzing fan and stakeholder reactions from platforms like Twitter, Reddit, and Web pages, the research aims to identify trends, biases, and patterns in sentiment towards VAR as a macth official.  

## Objectives  
- Collect and preprocess football-related social media data discussing VAR decisions.  
- Perform sentiment analysis using NLP techniques to classify fan opinions as positive, neutral, or negative.  
- Compare sentiment trends across major football leagues (e.g., EPL, La Liga, Serie A, Bundesliga).   
- Provide insights that could help football governing bodies, clubs, and analysts understand how VAR impacts fan sentiment.
