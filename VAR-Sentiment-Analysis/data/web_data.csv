Premier League,The 18yearold tripped up Wolves Matt Doherty as he looked to spring a counterattack following an Arsenal corner.,NEGATIVE,0.926842213
Premier League,It was an incident that would typically be punished with a yellow card given it appeared to be a professional foul.,NEGATIVE,0.999161363
Premier League,But Arsenals players were left flabbergasted when Oliver brandished a red with the Premier League since being urged to drop the referee.,NEGATIVE,0.891073048
Premier League,"Darren England, who was the VAR official for the contest, upheld Olivers decision as LewisSkellys tackle was deemed serious foul play. The decisionmaking of Oliver and England to brandish and subsequently double down on the red card left OHara shaking his head, labelling it one of the worst decisions Ive ever seen. However, the fact England had all the technology at his disposal and still came to the conclusion that LewisSkelly deserved a red card was what prompted OHara to demand VAR should be shut down.",NEGATIVE,0.999461234
Premier League,"Honestly, Ive watched the replay and Ive seen it in slomo, OHara said on talkSPORT.",POSITIVE,0.803963482
Premier League,Its almost like he Michael Oliver couldnt wait to get the red card out.,POSITIVE,0.698655784

Premier League,"For VAR to look at it and agree with him, it is absolutely disgraceful.",NEGATIVE,0.999231219
Premier League,"In every replay you watch, you can see LewisSkelly sticks his foot out, he wants to take a booking for the team.",NEGATIVE,0.803812504

Premier League,"For him to pull a red card out and say its serious foul play, that he went down the back of his Achilles, is a disgrace.",NEGATIVE,0.999774158
Premier League,VAR should get shut down.,NEGATIVE,0.999777734
Premier League,That is how bad VAR is.,NEGATIVE,0.999815285
Premier League,The fact they cant overturn that decision when theyve looked at it again.,NEGATIVE,0.883396268
Premier League,"All the technology youve got in that room, theyre all standing there, looking at that decision and they accept it was a red card?",POSITIVE,0.796696723

Premier League,"I am absolutely fuming but I leave it with you, he said.",POSITIVE,0.985102654
Premier League,I think it is that obvious that we dont need any comment today and hopefully the right thing will happen.,POSITIVE,0.986962855

Premier League,"OK, we were in a position that we shouldnt be in, at least lets be in a position that we should be in for the next few weeks and allow that player to continue to his job. Arteta also revealed he had not received any explanation on LewisSkellys red card.",NEGATIVE,0.998945296
Premier League,"As to whether Arsenal would appeal the red card, Arteta responded Thats for the club to decide what the best decision is.",POSITIVE,0.959997952

Premier League,"I think theyve got grounds for appealing, he told Soccer Saturday.",NEGATIVE,0.902445793
Premier League,Its just whether when the panel sits and reviews it exmanagers and explayers which way will they go?,NEGATIVE,0.998526931
Premier League,"I would think if they appeal, the way managers and players look at it, none of the players will think its a red card, so I think they may well win the appeal. LewisSkellys red card is the latest chapter in a string of VAR controversies this season.",NEGATIVE,0.97805357

Premier League,"However, replays showed it was Chalobah who made contact on Lewis rather than the other way around.",NEGATIVE,0.923509896
Premier League,"But given Lewis was shown a second yellow rather than a straight red, VAR could not intervene.",POSITIVE,0.546165705
Premier League,The issue of not being able to review sending offs that stem from a second yellow set Cundy off.,NEGATIVE,0.999693871
Premier League,"Look, it aint brilliant, it aint perfect, but its in the game and its going to stay, Cundy said.",POSITIVE,0.999196708
Premier League,Second yellow cards for a red have to be looked at by VAR.,NEGATIVE,0.9953022

Premier League,I dont get that.,NEGATIVE,0.998467028
Premier League,"If VAR is here to stay, right, and it is, improve the game, make it better, make it work.",POSITIVE,0.997726977

Premier League,"Eagles marksman JeanPhilippe Mateta scored a 92ndminute equaliser from the spot to rescue his side from 20 down, as the result ended 22.",POSITIVE,0.99807775

La Liga,"In 2024, individual referee tendencies varied widely This inconsistency fuels frustration among clubs, as teams are forced to adapt to vastly different officiating standards depending on the referee.",NEGATIVE,0.989089191
