Premier League,VAR cherry picking freeze frames for the refs,"Showing him anything occuring before the header would be in complete disregard for the rules. There was no chance of him being offside as the ball swung into Stones because you can't be offside from a corner kick. 

What was the position and his actions at and after the header? That is the only point at which he can possibly commit an offside offence. By then he had separated from Sa and wasn't obstructing his view, and the rules are very clear that simply being in an offside position alone without interfering is not an offence. 

I genuinely think this is a fantastic decision from the referee, especially as they know the expectation is that most decisions are overturned when they check the monitor (rightly or wrongly). We give them stick when they fuck up and he deserves credit here.

And lets clarify that Silva standing his ground, or 'backing into' Sa isn't a foul before some people argue that line. You can only be penalised for obstruction if you move into the way of a player as they would try to play the ball, but Silva had already picked up that position before corner.

La Liga,The truth about refereeing in LaLiga.,"Problem is inconsistency. The same handball can be a penalty in one game and ""play-on"" in another. The same tackle can be a direct red card in one game and only a yellow in another.

Offsides are another issue. Semi-automatic offsides have made mistakes this year, additionally - VAR referees are inconsistent when to pause - is it the pass action or the ball actually already on the way to the recipient (in very close situations, this can be the difference between offside and legal play).

The Mbappe offside in the game between Las Palmas and Real just yesterday, was another failure of VAR. It went completely against VAR protocol, because VAR checked the offside in a previous play. When Las Palmas player cleared the ball, it was the end of the play - you either raise the flag there or not, then another Las Palmas player had possession of the ball which he lost and from this stolen ball, Real Madrid scored.

Pick the matches before VAR and consistently you will see both our teams getting 50-50 calls go in our favor on offsides / penalties etc

what Real Madrid official statement said wasn't a victim card but a fair demand for a change in refereeing system.

Roma-Monza, step on foot on Baldanzi, probably one of the most clear fouls I've seen this year - not called but surely reviewed.


The fact that it wasn't awarded has to go in the ""call against the club"" even it was a mistake.

Even the Thuram Pavlovic contact from the derby must be considered as a decision in favor of Milan.


If this only takes into account when a VAR check is ""officially called"" and the referee has to go and watch the action back, I can't help but to feel like this list is absolutely useless.

The referees this year have been absolutely devastating (I could mention other offenses for Napoli, Juve, Milan, Atalanta, Torino, Fiorentina, ecc.... but that's not the point) and VAR surely has a blind eye that often doesn't correct the obvious mistake.","I'm gonna straight up come forward and ask: how is this list made?

Good afternoon guys,

Just posted a new weekly series profiling some of the underrated ballers that Serie A had during the 90’s, 00’s and ‘10’s.

The first episode details the career of Roma legend, Rodrigo Taddei, who made close to 300 appearances in 9 seasons at the Olimpico. A hardworking, smiling winger who was a Swiss Army knife type player who endeared himself to the Roman faithful 🟡🔴

Das Problem am VAR ist nicht der VAR. Der Fußball hat allgemein ein Regelwerkproblem das zuviel Interpretationsspielraum gibt der nicht klar definiert ist. Dem Schiedsrichter wird der Freiraum gegeben im Zweifel ""im Sinne des Spiels"" zu entscheiden, was halt absoluter rotz ist.

In anderen Sportarten gibt es das in der Form nicht. Davor stehen zig andere Abwägungen: War es eine böswillige Aktion? Entstand dem Team ein unfairer Vorteil? Erst ganz am Ende kommt irgendwann ""im Sinne des Spiels"", was quasi nie Eintritt da davor einer der anderen Abwägungen schon erfüllt wurde. Sowas wie Cucurellas Handspiel würde es in 99% der anderen Sportarten nicht geben, weil der VAR dort die 100%ige Entscheidungsgewalt hätte da dem Team ein unfairer Vorteil durch die Aktion entstand, dadurch das der Ball sonst aufs Tor ging.

Alkohol und Menschenmengen mit Pyrotechnik zusammen auf engstem Raum sind eine beschissene Kombination und den Stress nicht wert.

Rettungskräfte drehen an Silvester Überstunden um sich um die ganzen Unfälle zu kümmern. Das, zusätzlich mit dem Risiko einer Massenpanik, ists einfach nicht Wert.

Das mit den Ticketpreisen versteh ich auch nicht ganz. Die sind schon relativ niedrig, ein Stadion betreibt sich nicht von selbst und die Inflation/wirtschaftliche Lage der letzten 1-2 Jahre setzt halt allen etwas zu. Da ists zu erwarten, dass die Ticketpreise etwas anziehen. Die Vereine sind keine Wohlfahrt, und in den meisten Fällen kommt das Geld am Ende ja auch den Vereinen zu Gute.","The problem with the VAR is not the VAR.

Bundesliga,Jablonski gibt Fehlentscheidung zu und kritisiert das Regelwerk des VAR,"Finds super das er da direkt n Interview gibt und sah für mich auch so aus als ob ihn das schon auch etwas mitgenommen hat.


Trotzdem find ich die Aussage zu der gelb-roten Karte er habe Arnold schreien gehört und ihn danach auch noch gefragt ob er gefoult wurde etwas komisch. Klar sagt dir der Spieler das er gefoult wurde, vorallem einer wie Arnold. Und das der der am lautesten schreit, grad bei Fussballprofis, oft nicht der Gefoulte ist sollte auch bei den Schiedsrichtern in der Zwischenzeit angekommen sein.


Zu der roten Karte ist das jetzt Auslegungssache oder gibts da ne eindeutige Regel?


Gab da ja unterschiedliche Aussagen.","Finds great that he gives directly n interview and also looked for me as if it had taken him a bit with it. Nevertheless, I find the statement to the yellow-red card he heard Arnold scream and asked him if he was being bullied a bit funny. Of course the player that he was being bullied, especially one like Arnold tells you.

Bundesliga,Jablonski gibt Fehlentscheidung zu und kritisiert das Regelwerk des VAR,"Guter Mann. Recht hat er. 

Die Gerichtsbarkeit des DFB sollte die Sakrosanktheit der Tatsachenentscheidungen ihrer Schiedsrichter aufheben. Der Meinung bin ich, seit Wolfgang Stark vor Ewigkeiten Marcel Schmelzer wegen eines vermeintlichen Handspiels auf der Linie mit Rot vom Platz geschickt und Wolfsburg einen unrechtmäßigen Elfmeter zugesprochen hat. Damals wurde Schmelzer übrigens nicht gesperrt. Für gelbrote Karten gibt es einige Präzedenzfälle, in denen die falsche Tatsachenentscheidung Bestand hat. 

Selten gab es eine bessere Gelegenheit, dieses Relikt alter Tage abzuschaffen. Ich hoffe, Jablonski hat eine Anmerkung in den Spielbericht geschrieben.",Good man. He is right. The jurisdiction of the DFB should remove the sacrosanctity of the factual decisions of its arbitrators. I believe that since Wolfgang Stark sent Marcel Schmelzer from the square because of an alleged hand game on the line with red and Wolfsburg an illegal penalty. At that time Schmelzer was not blocked by the way. For yellow-red cards there are some precedents in which the wrong factual decision persists.,NEUTRAL,0.550218463,-0.089285714

Der Schiri sollte einfach die Option bekommen, sich eine Szene nochmal auf dem Bildschirm anzuschauen. Es liegt dann in seinem Ermessen ob er es tut oder nicht. Ggf könnten die Trainer eine Option bekommen, ihn 1x pro Halbzeit dazu zu zwingen oder so was.

Alle bis auf einen, und der ist dummerweise der, der die Entscheidung treffen soll. Also gibt man ihm einfach die Option.

Abseits ist noch ein Sonderfall, aber die Jungs mit der kalibrierten Linie könnten ja auch im Stadion sitzen. Bei dem Millionengeschäft sollte das doch machbar sein.
