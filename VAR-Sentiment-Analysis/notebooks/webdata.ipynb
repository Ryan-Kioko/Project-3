            "  Jamie O'Hara has called for an 'investigation' into VAR following Arsenal teen Myles Lewis-Skelly's controversial red card. Lewis-Skelly was sent off by referee Michael Oliver late in the first half of Arsenal's 1-0 win over Wolves at Molineux. The 18-year-old tripped up Wolves' Matt Doherty as he looked to spring a counter-attack following an Arsenal corner. It was an incident that would typically be punished with a yellow card given it appeared to be a professional foul. But Arsenal's players were left flabbergasted when Oliver brandished a red - with the Premier League since being urged to drop the referee. Darren England, who was the VAR official for the contest, upheld Oliver's decision as Lewis-Skelly's tackle was deemed 'serious foul play.' The decision-making of Oliver and England to brandish and subsequently double down on the red card left O'Hara shaking his head, labelling it 'one of the worst decisions I've ever seen.' However, the fact England had all the technology at his disposal and still came to the conclusion that Lewis-Skelly deserved a red card was what prompted O'Hara to demand VAR 'should be shut down'. \"Honestly, I've watched the replay and I've seen it in slo-mo,\" O'Hara said on talkSPORT. \"It's almost like he (Michael Oliver) couldn't wait to get the red card out. It was unbelievable what I saw.  \"For VAR to look at it and agree with him, it is absolutely disgraceful.  \"In every replay you watch, you can see Lewis-Skelly sticks his foot out, he wants to take a booking for the team. Every footballer has done it, everyone. It's not serious foul play, it's a professional play. You take one for the team, you take a yellow and you move on.  \"For him to pull a red card out and say it's serious foul play, that he went down the back of his Achilles, is a disgrace. \"VAR should get shut down. That is how bad VAR is. The fact they can't overturn that decision when they've looked at it again. All the technology you've got in that room, they're all standing there, looking at that decision and they accept it was a red card?  \"There has to be an investigation into what's going on there.\" Arteta said he was too 'fuming' to comment on it, but wants the decision overturned in the same way Manchester United midfielder Bruno Fernandes was let off following a red card against Tottenham earlier in the season. \"I am absolutely fuming but I leave it with you,\" he said. \"I think it is that obvious that we don't need any comment today and hopefully the right thing will happen. \"Hopefully we don't need to (appeal the decision) and if we have to, there is a really good precedent, what happened with Bruno this season as well. \"OK, we were in a position that we shouldn't be in, at least let's be in a position that we should be in for the next few weeks and allow that player to continue to his job.\" Arteta also revealed he had not received any explanation on Lewis-Skelly's red card. As to whether Arsenal would appeal the red card, Arteta responded: \"That's for the club to decide what the best decision is. I think it's that obvious, maybe we don't even need to.\" Former referee Mike Dean believes the club have huge grounds to appeal it and are likely to win. \"I think they've got grounds for appealing,\" he told Soccer Saturday. \"It's just whether when the panel sits and reviews it - ex-managers and ex-players - which way will they go? I would think if they appeal, the way managers and players look at it, none of the players will think it's a red card, so I think they may well win the appeal.\" Lewis-Skelly's red card is the latest chapter in a string of VAR controversies this season. O'Hara and fellow talkSPORT pundit Jason Cundy were shocked when Manchester City's Rico Lewis was shown a second yellow against Crystal Palace for a challenge on Trevoh Chalobah. However, replays showed it was Chalobah who made contact on Lewis rather than the other way around. But given Lewis was shown a second yellow rather than a straight red, VAR could not intervene. The issue of not being able to review sending offs that stem from a second yellow set Cundy off. \"VAR is... Look, it ain't brilliant, it ain't perfect, but it's in the game and it's going to stay,\" Cundy said. \"Second yellow cards for a red have to be looked at by VAR. I don't understand how a straight red can be looked at, yet a second yellow for a red can't be. I don't get that. \"Improve the game. If VAR is here to stay, right, and it is, improve the game, make it better, make it work. Because for me, that second yellow, it's not a second yellow.\" Palace were also the beneficiaries of VAR earlier in the season against Leicester City. Eagles marksman Jean-Philippe Mateta scored a 92nd-minute equaliser from the spot to rescue his side from 2-0 down, as the result ended 2-2. But former Foxes boss Steve Cooper was left irate over the Frenchman's first goal as it was initially flagged for offside, only for VAR to overturn the decision and award it. Yet Cooper was adamant VAR used the wrong freeze-frame to determine whether Mateta was offside or not. The club met with PGMOL, the governing body of referees in England, to discuss the matter two days after the match but it was explained to them there was no human error and the correct frame was used. © 2025 talkSPORT Limited\n",
